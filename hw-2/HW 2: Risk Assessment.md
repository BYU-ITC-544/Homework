# HW 2: Risk Assessments

Risk assessments are a foundational component of an organization's risk management strategy, aimed at identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential threats to its operations, assets, and personnel. This systematic process involves recognizing hazards, analyzing the likelihood and impact of these risks, and determining appropriate measures to minimize or eliminate them. By conducting thorough risk assessments, organizations can proactively address vulnerabilities, improve decision-making, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

## Instructions:

You will create a comprehensive risk management plan for the network you designed in milestone 1. The document should be professional in its formatting and be easy to understand and navigate.

Your plan should at a minimum contain the following:

1. Identify assets: Identify the assets that need to be protected, such as servers, databases, applications, and network devices.

1. Identify threats: Identify potential threats that could impact the assets, such as malware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and denial-of-service attacks.

1. Assess vulnerabilities: Assess the vulnerabilities of the assets by conducting vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and other security assessments.

1. Determine likelihood and impact: Determine the likelihood and impact of each potential risk based on the identified threats and vulnerabilities. This can be done using a risk matrix or other risk assessment tools.

1. Prioritize risks: Prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact and assign a risk level to each risk.

1. Develop mitigation strategies: Develop mitigation strategies to reduce the risk level of each identified risk. Mitigation strategies can include implementing security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls, and encryption.

1. Implement controls: Implement the selected security controls to reduce the risk level of each identified risk.

1. Monitor and review: Monitor the network and services regularly to detect any new vulnerabilities and to ensure that the implemented security controls are effective.

In addition to a written document, you should create a spreadsheet to document any risks you have identified and any information pertaining to that risk.
