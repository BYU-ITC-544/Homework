# HW 6: Disater Recovery Policy

A Disaster Recovery Policy is an essential framework designed to ensure an organization's ability to recover and maintain its critical functions in the event of a significant disruption, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or system failures. This policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for responding to and recovering from disasters, focusing on minimizing downtime and data loss, and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible. Effective disaster recovery planning not only helps safeguard an organization's data and infrastructure but also ensures business continuity, protects stakeholder interests, and maintains compliance with regulatory requirements. By establishing clear protocols for disaster response, communication, and recovery processes, a Disaster Recovery Policy provides a structured approach to dealing with unforeseen events, enhancing the organization's resilience and preparedness.
