# HW 5: Backup Policy

A backup policy is a crucial document that outlines the procedures and guidelines for creating, storing, and managing copies of an organization's data. This policy ensures that vital information is protected against loss, corruption, or unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding the organization's operations and assets. Effective backup policies are essential for minimizing downtime, preventing data loss due to accidental deletions, hardware failures, or cyberattacks, and ensuring business continuity. By establishing clear protocols for regular data backups, storage locations, access controls, and recovery procedures, a backup policy helps an organization quickly restore its systems and data to maintain seamless operations. The goal is to create a robust and reliable framework that supports data integrity, security, and availability at all times.
