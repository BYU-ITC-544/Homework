# HW 3: Operational Assessments

Operational assessments are a vital process for evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and overall performance of an organization's operations. This systematic review focuses on analyzing various aspects of the organization's day-to-day activities, including processes, systems, and procedures. By identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within these areas, operational assessments provide valuable insights into how well an organization is meeting its objectives and where improvements can be made. The ultimate goal is to enhance operational efficiency, ensure optimal use of resources, and drive continuous improvement. Through regular operational assessments, organizations can adapt to changing conditions, streamline workflows, and achieve greater productivity and success.
